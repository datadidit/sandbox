## Notes

### Chapter 9

* Updating Node on Mac

```bash
# NVM is being managed by homebrew for now but nvm doesn't suggest this.
# Installed the minimum version for tutorial since I need to upgrade OS to get latest version
nvm install 18.19.1
```
* Run the app using the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
* Chapter ends with route in a broken state.
